## Permission Handling Playground Privacy Policy

The Permission handling playground application is an open source app written in flutter, it was created only for educational purposes, it shows how to properly handle permissions in a flutter application, and it shows visually if the application got the permission or not.

### Data collection

The application uses no analytics software, it does not intend to receive or store any data from the user thus it is not programmed to collect any data.

### Permission requirements

While the application requires nearly every permission available, it will not have any advantage by having any permission granted. The only reason is to educate, to show the developer the feedbacks of the application when one is allowed or denyed.

### Open source

The application is open source, you can see yourself the privacy policy is followed by checking out https://github.com/PoPovok/permission-handling-playground
